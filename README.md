# Welcome! 

My name's [Bastian](https://bastian.rieck.me) and I'm a researcher. I started out as a mathematician, but am perennially meandering between this subject and computer science. These days, I am primarily interested in understanding how geometrical–topological information 🍩 can improve machine learning or deep learning.

Other than that, I like to build better academic systems and help people navigate this jungle. I also enjoy general discussions on software development, literature, and much more...
