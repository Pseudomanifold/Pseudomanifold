# Welcome! 

My name's [Bastian](https://bastian.rieck.me) and I'm a researcher. I used to be a mathematician (like you?), until I found my love for computers and computer science. These days, I am primarily interested in understanding how geometrical–topological information 🍩 can improve machine learning.

Other than that, I am interested in building better academic systems, and help people navigate this jungle. I also enjoy general discussions on software development, literature, and much more...
